## Project Description
This project will be a **Login and Registration Form** web application.  
Users will be able to **register** with their details and **log in** securely.  

We plan to implement **input validation, responsive design, and interactivity** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
The project is structured to be expandable so that by the end of the course, we can connect it to a backend and database for full functionality.  

Each team member will contribute to different parts of the project, and updates will be added to the repository throughout the semester.
