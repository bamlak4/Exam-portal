## Problem Statement

Teachers often spend a lot of time preparing and grading paper-based exams, while students face delays in receiving results and limited flexibility in taking tests. This manual process is slow, stressful, and prone to errors. The Online Examination System aims to solve these issues by providing a web-based platform where teachers can easily create and manage exams, and students can take them online with instant, fair, and accurate results.


## Project Description

The Online Exam portal is a web-based platform that makes giving and taking exams easier, faster, and more reliable. Instead of using traditional paper tests, this system lets students take their exams online from anywhere. Teachers can create and manage exams in just a few clicks.

The platform automatically checks answers for objective questions, shows instant results, and tracks each student’s performance over time. This saves teachers hours of manual grading and ensures fairness in evaluation.

For students, it offers a simple, secure, and stress-free way to take exams. With features like a countdown timer and automatic submission, students can focus on their answers without worrying about time management or technical problems.

Overall, this project aims to bring convenience and efficiency to both teachers and learners. It seeks to modernize the exam process by combining technology with education. This creates a smoother, smarter, and more accessible experience for everyone involved.
